@todo
- Consider tweaking pixel scale so the average scale is as specified, rather than the scale at the center
- The sky tiles could be pentagonal (or some approximation), not rectangular
  and still preserve the desired minimum overlap. This would cut down a bit on the number
  of pixels to store per tile, but would make the code more complex.
